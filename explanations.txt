Question1:


This is simple problem to find substring, and anagram substring also included.

For Python, have a good funtion to find subset.

ex) sample.find(sub)

This complexity would be O(Log N) because it will use fast search algorithm.

So, First case considering no anagram substring. If find substring return True.

Second, Find anagram using reverse string. If find anagram  substring return True.

Third, neither find substing return False.

Total complexity would be O(Log 2N) because using two time search.

Question2:


To find palindromic substring, I can compare my origin sting and reversed sting and find repeatition range.

Initialize my reverse sting.

And I used for loop to search each character using index.

Why I used for loop index. Because the problem is find the longest palindromic substring, 

reversed string's first index will be origin string's last element. If I find some palindromic substring through the method,
it has high probability become the longest one.

Ex)

"abbba" index[0]=a

"abbba" index[0]=a

maching => find longest one."abbba"

And to progress my algorithm I used slice string method.

each loop step will slice my reversed sting.

Ex)

"abbba" -> "bbba" -> "bba"

slice string is very useful and fast.

To prevent my algorithm high complexity that it can search whole set of charecter. O(n^2), 
I used break function compare my founded palindromic substring's length 
and another founded palindromic substring's length.

Using those method, I can build fast algorithm.

Question3:

Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal¡¯s algorithm

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.

2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree 
formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.  

3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

#Step 1: Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. If we are not allowed to change the given graph, we can create a copy of graph

Make two dictionary dataset for union that does union of two sets of x and y uses union by rank. root dictionary indicate edge's root and rank diction indicate their rank status. 

Union by Rank: Attach smaller rank tree under root of high rank tree. If ranks are same, then make one as root and increment

Step 2: Pick the smallest edge and increment the index for next iteration
 
If including this edge does't cause cycle, include it in result and increment the index of result for next edge.

-Since including this edge results in cycle, discard it.
-Pick edge: No cycle is formed, include it.

Question4:

Given values of two values n1 and n2 in a Binary Search Tree, find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). You may assume that both the values exist in the tree.

Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root. Computation of lowest common ancestors may be useful, for instance, as part of a procedure for determining the distance between pairs of nodes in a tree: the distance from n1 to n2 can be computed as the distance from the root to n1, plus the distance from the root to n2, minus twice the distance from the root to their lowest common ancestor.

If we are given a BST where every node has parent pointer, then LCA can be easily determined by traversing up using parent pointer and printing the first intersecting node.

We can solve this problem using BST properties. We can recursively traverse the BST from root. The main idea of the solution is, while traversing from top to bottom, the first node n we encounter with value between n1 and n2, i.e., n1 < n < n2 or same as one of the n1 or n2, is LCA of n1 and n2 (assuming that n1 < n2). So just recursively traverse the BST in, if node¡¯s value is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies in left side of the node, if it¡¯s is smaller than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies on right side. Otherwise root is LCA (assuming that both n1 and n2 are present in BST)

Make a base Case if root is None: return None value.

If both n1 and n2 are smaller than root, then LCA lies in left.
If both n1 and n2 are greater than root, then LCA lies in right.

For search left tree or right tree. I used binary search method. it started middle point and move to left or right to find each left tree or right tree child.

Question5:

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

Thus, Linke list is difficult to search element using index.

To simply solve this problem.

I store Linked List data to array. Using recursive function.
And simply using index number to find m is the "mth number from the end". by length of linked list minus mth number from the end.
